# Sweet Actions
#### a Ruby on Rails Gem

---

## Let's REST not STRESS

Implementing a REST JSON API should be:

- easy
- consistent
- secure
- extendable

---

## Job to be Done

What is the Job that REST is solving?

- Users need to interact with our database
- They can do so by either creating a new record or reading, updating, or destroying an existing record (CRUD)

---

For example, given an **Events** resource:

- See an event
- See a list of events
- Create an event
- Update an event
- Delete an event

---

## The Big 5

- show
- index
- create
- update
- destroy

---

## Good News

Consistency = easy to program

...or at least it should be

---

## Current Process

We are focused on the **resource** instead of the **action**

```ruby
class EventsController
  def index; end
  def show; end
  def create; end
  def update; end
  def destroy; end
end
```

**resource = class, actions = methods**

---

## But wait...

Which do you think has more in common?

1. events#create <=> events#index
2. events#create <=> articles#create

---

```ruby
class EventsController
  def create
    event = Event.new(event_params)
    raise NotAuthorized unless can?(:create, event)

    if event.save
      # success
    else
      # failure
    end
  end

  def index
    events = Event.where(date: >= Date.today)
    serialize(events)
  end
end
```

---

```ruby
class EventsController
  def create
    event = Event.new(event_params)
    raise NotAuthorized unless can?(:create, event)

    if event.save
      # success
    else
      # failure
    end
  end
end

class ArticlesController
  def create
    article = Article.new(article_params)
    raise NotAuthorized unless can?(:create, article)

    if article.save
      # success
    else
      # failure
    end
  end
end
```

---

## Answer: #2

```ruby
'events#create' == 'articles#create'
'events#create' != 'events#index'
```

---

### Actions as First Class Citizens

Since the actions have more in common with each other than they do with the resources to which they belong, it is the actions that should be objects instead of the resource.

---

```ruby
class CreateAction < SweetActionsRest::CreateAction
  def action
    resource = set_resource
    resource.save ? success : failure
  end

  private

  def set_resource
    resource_class.new(resource_params)
  end

  def resource_params
    decanter.new(params[resource_name])
  end
end
```

---

```ruby
module Events
  class Create < CreateAction
    def after_save
      UserMailer.send_event_confirmation.deliver_later
    end
  end
end
```

---

## Demo

1. Install gem
2. Generate resource (model, decanter, serializer, actions)
3. Add routes

Note: you may want to disable protect_from_forgery
---

## 1. Install Gem

Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sweet_actions'
```

Terminal:

```
bundle
bundle exec rails g sweet_actions:install
```

---

## 2. Generate Resource

```
rails g model Event name:string start_date:date
bundle exec rake db:migrate
rails g decanter Event name:string start_date:date
rails g serializer Event name:string start_date:date
rails g actions Events
```

---

## 3. Add Routes

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  create_sweet_actions(:events)
end
```
